    <title>The Bus Jogger!</title>
    <description>I am the bus jogger! Running with the bus gives me many options to plan my runs. Linear runs, new areas and split runs are some of the exciting things I will be blogging about.

        <title>I am the Bus Jogger!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What is bus jogging?  I came up with the idea of running with the bus as  it combines both my love of running and my fascination with public transport.  Our bus network is the most extensive public transport network in our country. It connects virtually every village to a key town.  Bus routes extend to areas out of reach of railways.  Itâ€™s possible to just hop on and off every few miles along the route.  This makes buses an excellent resource to use to create more interesting running routes.&lt;/p&gt;
